# NetObj::MacAddress

The Perl module NetObj::MacAddress represents [MAC
addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address).  The goal is to use an
abstraction independent of any particular string representation.

NetObj::MacAddress is a class built using Moo and fits right into the Moose
object oriented framework.
